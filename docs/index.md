## Intro

*A swiss army knife like collection of little code snippets, examples, or commands you need to look up from time to time. That and stuff, i just wanted to write down.*

## How

This page is hosted on GH with an automated workflow to build it in mkdocs, hopefully it works like i hope for. ;)

## Project layout

tbd and stuff

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
